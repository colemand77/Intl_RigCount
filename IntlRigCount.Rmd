This document was inspired by a [this post](http://oilpro.com/post/17343/comparing-international-rig-count-fall-to-us) on OilPro, which compared the change in Internatioal Rig Count to the US land rig count.  It occured to me that the "International" label included a great many regions, so I thought it might be interesting to explore a bit deeper.  As a result, we have this little to WebApp that lest you dig into the BHI International Rig count with a bit more detail.

Set filter conditions above the two charts... click and drag on the top chart to zoom in on a period of interest. The bottom chart is indexed to the first period show in the top chart.  Double-click to reset zoom.
Play around.
